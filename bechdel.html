            <p> The Bechdel test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women or girls who talk to each other about something other than a man or boy, and the two women or girls must be named. About half of all films meet these requirements, according to user-edited databases and the media industry press. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to gender inequality in both. Also known as the Bechdelâ€“Wallace test, the test is named after the American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, in whose comic strip 'Dykes to Watch Out For' first appeared in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of Virginia Woolf. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.</p>
